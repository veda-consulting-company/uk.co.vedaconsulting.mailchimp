   * Identify a contact who is expected to be subscribed to this list.
   *
   * This is used in a couple of cases, for finding a contact from incomming
   * data for:
   * - a possibly new contact, 
   * - a contact that is expected to be in this membership group.
   *
   * Here's how we match a contact:
   *
   * - Only non-deleted contacts are returned.
   *
   * - Email is unique in CiviCRM
   *   Contact identified, unless limited to in-group only and not in group.
   *
   * - Email is entered 2+ times, but always on the same contact.
   *   Contact identified, unless limited to in-group only and not in group.
   *
   * - Email belongs to 2+ different contacts. In this situation, if there are
   *   some contacts that are in the membership group, we ignore the other match
   *   candidates. If limited to in-group contacts and there aren't any, we give
   *   up now.
   *
   *   - Email identified if it belongs to only one contact that is in the
   *     membership list.
   *
   *   - Look to the candidates whose last name matches.
   *     - Email identified if there's only one last name match.
   *     - If there are any contacts that also match first name, return one of
   *       these. We say it doesn't matter if there's duplicates - just pick
   *       one since everything matches.
   *
   *   - Email identified if there's a single contact that matches on first
   *     name.
   *
   * We fail with a CRM_Mailchimp_DuplicateContactsException if the email
   * belonged to several contacts and we could not narrow it down by name.
   *
   * @param string $email
   * @param string|null $first_name
   * @param string|null $last_name
   * @param bool $must_be_on_list    If TRUE, only return an ID if this contact
